# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm start                              # start Expo dev server
npm run ios                            # build + install on iOS simulator
npx expo run:ios --device <UDID>       # build + install on physical device
npm run web                            # start in browser
npm test                               # run Jest test suite (388 tests)
```

TypeScript strict mode enabled. Uses Expo SDK 54 (compatible with Xcode 16.4).

## Stack

- **Expo SDK 54 / React Native** — iOS + Android + Web from one codebase
- **TypeScript** strict mode
- **Zustand** — app-wide state (auth, screen, lobby, games)
- **useReducer** — game engine state (kept local because the reducer is pure)
- **Supabase** — Postgres + Realtime for multiplayer (anonymous auth for now)
- **Space Mono** — monospace font via `@expo-google-fonts/space-mono`

Bundle ID: `com.leenapthine.battlechess`

## Architecture

Three architectural layers:

1. **Engine** (`src/engine/`) — pure TypeScript, zero React, zero side effects. The game reducer and all piece modules.
2. **Lib** (`src/lib/`) — pure API functions for external services (Supabase). Zero React.
3. **Stores** (`src/stores/`) — Zustand stores that wrap lib calls with state. Components subscribe via hooks. NEVER consume Zustand inside library files or piece modules.

### Screen file structure (Header / View / Hook)

Every non-trivial screen folder contains:
- `useFeature.ts` — all logic, state, handlers. Zero JSX.
- `FeatureView.tsx` — pure presentational. Props only.
- `FeatureHeader.tsx` — presentational header. Props only.
- `index.tsx` — thin composition root wiring hook to views.

Simple screens (SignIn, NamePrompt, WaitingRoom, Handoff) skip the split and put everything in `index.tsx`.

### Engine design

All game logic is pure TypeScript — no React, no signals, no mutation.
- Piece modules: `getValidMoves(piece, pieces) → Highlight[]`
- State transitions: `gameReducer(state, action) → GameState`
- Multi-step abilities tracked by `AbilityMode` discriminated union
- Piece-specific capture dispatch in `captureDispatch.ts` (WizardTower stays put, HellKing converts, Prowler second move, etc.)

### File size

~150 lines soft cap. Extract helpers proactively.

## Multiplayer

End-to-end realtime over Supabase. Database is the source of truth.

- **Anonymous auth** — users get a UUID via `signInAnonymously()`, prompted for a display name on first sign-in
- **Lobby** — `games` rows where status='waiting' are visible to all signed-in users; hosts can browse and join
- **State sync model** — active player runs reducer locally, writes new `GameState` to `games.game_state` column. Other player subscribes via Supabase Realtime and receives updates.
- **Army selection** — each player writes their own army to `host_army` / `guest_army` columns. When both are set, host calls `startGame` which initializes `game_state` and flips status to 'active'.
- **Reconnection** — on app start, `restoreMyGame` queries for any non-finished game the user is part of and resumes
- **Orphan cleanup** — lobby filters games >10min old; host's stale waiting games auto-deleted on app start
- **Local pass-and-play** — still available as a mode; bypasses Supabase entirely
- **Per-player clocks** — `host_time_ms` / `guest_time_ms` columns hold each player's time bank; active player's clock ticks down, hitting 0 = timeout loss
- **Win reasons** — `game_state.status` carries `reason: 'kingCapture' | 'resign' | 'timeout'` so the overlay can show the right banner
- **Lobby chat** — `chat_messages` table backs a global terminal-style chat panel on the lobby screen; server-side trigger enforces 1 message / 2 sec rate limit

Database schema lives in `supabase/schema.sql`. RLS is enabled on all tables.

## Visual design

Homebrew terminal aesthetic — black background, bright green accents, monospace throughout. The board is an 8×8 grid of React Native `Pressable` squares with White at the bottom.

- **Theme:** black bg (#000000), green board squares (#2d8c2d / #1a6b1a), green text (#00ff00), Space Mono font
- **Highlights:** thick inner square borders rendered under sprites
  - Green border — selected piece
  - Blue border — selected piece has self-click ability available
  - Yellow border — valid move
  - Red border — capture or anything that will die (including friendly in blast)
  - Grey border — range indicator on empty/friendly/stone squares (non-interactive)
  - Grey lighter — preview (opponent piece range, read-only)
- **Self-click pieces** hide ability targets until activated: NecroPawn, GhoulKing, DeadLauncher, Beholder, BoulderThrower, Familiar, Portal, WizardKing
- **Sprite info cards** appear above (Black) or below (White) the board when a piece is tapped
- **Header** shows current turn, ability-mode instructions, and flash messages
- **Sprites** pre-upscaled to 128×128 with nearest-neighbor for pixel-perfect rendering at any size

### Visual effects (`src/screens/Game/effects/`)

A Reanimated animation layer sits above the board. Two systems:
- **Per-move** (no engine involvement): `AnimatedPiece` glides sprites (FLIP) and `DyingPiece` fades captures, detected by ID-diffing `pieces` in `GameView`.
- **Ability effects**: the reducer writes a typed `Effect` to `GameState.lastEffect` (cleared to `null` on every other action); `EffectRenderer` routes it to a primitive that calls `onDone` to clear the queue. All 17 `Effect` types are emitted/rendered. Every primitive is **hand-rolled pixel art** (grids of square `View`s — no SVG/Skia, so no native dep): `LightningBolt` (WizardKing/WizardTower), `EyeBeam` (Beholder), `FireBurst` (YoungWiz), `BoulderThrow` (BoulderThrower), `PixelExplosion` (NecroPawn), `LaunchProjectile` (DeadLauncher — loaded pawn sprite, spinning), `PixelBurst` (versatile particle poof — transform/convert/raise/revive/dominate/swap/portalOut/howlerAbsorb), `StunPulse` (GhostKnight), `StonePulse` (Familiar). **Invariant:** every `EffectRenderer` branch must eventually call `onDone` or the queue stalls (e.g. the `stun` case guards an empty `affected` array). See GAME_OVERVIEW.md "Visual Effects" for the full effect→primitive map.
- **Last-move replay**: a ⟳ Replay button (local Game screen) re-plays the previous turn. `useGame` records each turn as a sequence of board frames (one per sub-move, so multi-step turns replay in full); `GameView` re-stages them through the existing animation machinery (seeding `AnimatedPiece` positions so there's no rewind-slide). Real `GameState` is untouched. Online wiring is a pending follow-up.

### Test suite

388 tests across 38 suites — pure engine logic + data completeness checks, no React rendering tests yet.

## Game reference

See `GAME_OVERVIEW.md` for the full game design: all 4 guilds, 24 piece abilities, starting configurations, edge cases, and known bugs.

## Environment

Requires `.env` at repo root with:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_...
```
See `.env.example` for template. NEVER commit `.env` (gitignored) or the secret key.
